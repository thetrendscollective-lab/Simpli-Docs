Love this question. Here are the features that would make Simplidocs feel magical (and hard to copy), grouped by value + how quickly you can ship them with your current stack.

1) Understand-at-a-glance (UX “wow”)

Side-by-side “Original ↔ Plain English” with a toggle.

Highlight-to-Explain: select any sentence/term → instant plain-language popover (grounded to that exact spot).

Reading level slider: Simple / Standard / Detailed (just pass a level param to /api/explain).

Confidence & Source chips: show short quotes from the document under each bullet so users see where it came from.

2) Actionable guidance (not advice)

Deadline detector → checklist: auto-pull dates/“within X days” phrases; show a countdown and “Add to Calendar (.ics)” button.

Smart Q&A (grounded): ask follow-ups that cite the matching lines/section.

One-click templates: generate drafts like insurance appeal, clarification email to clinic, request for records (user edits before sending).

3) Medical & insurance superpowers

EOB explainer: “What was billed → Allowed → Insurance paid → You owe” with a tiny bar chart.

ICD/CPT plain-language definitions inline; flag likely duplicates or denials; call out appeal window if present.

Visit prep card: “Questions to ask your doctor next” generated from the findings.

4) Legal document clarity

Parties, jurisdiction, and deadlines panel with a response clock.

Clause snapshots: compress each key clause into one line; expand for details.

Form finder (non-advisory): suggest official form names/links that match the doc’s topic (e.g., “proof of service,” “answer form”).

5) Trust & privacy (big differentiator)

Ephemeral Mode: auto-delete files and text after 24h (toggle at upload).

Share-safe links: time-limited, revocable links to the summary only (watermarked with viewer email/time).

PII-gentle previews: blur names/IDs in the preview while keeping originals secure in Storage.

6) Accessibility & language

Read-aloud for summaries (Web Speech API in browser).

Dyslexia-friendly mode (font/spacing toggle).

Translate + explain (English ↔ Spanish at minimum) with the same structure (summary, bullets, glossary, actions).

7) Workflow & export

Case Binder: group multiple docs into a timeline (e.g., hospital stay → bills → appeals).

One-click Export: branded PDF of the explanation + glossary; optional CSV of action items.

Notes & bookmarks: let users pin lines from the original and attach their own notes.

8) Monetization that feels fair

Free: 2 docs/month, basic explanation.

Standard: unlimited explanations, deadlines → calendar, read-aloud, translations.

Pro: EOB analyzer, legal deadlines clock, case binder, share-safe links, exports.

Family/Caregiver plan: 3–5 seats with a shared binder.
