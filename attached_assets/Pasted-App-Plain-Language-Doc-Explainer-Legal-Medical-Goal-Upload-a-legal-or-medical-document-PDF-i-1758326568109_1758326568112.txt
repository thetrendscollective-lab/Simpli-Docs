App: Plain-Language Doc Explainer (Legal & Medical)

Goal:
Upload a legal or medical document (PDF/image/docx), then get a plain-language explanation in the user’s preferred language. The app highlights key sections, defines jargon, summarizes clauses/findings, and answers follow-up questions.

Core Features (MVP)

Upload & OCR

Accept PDF, DOCX, TXT, PNG/JPG.

Use OCR for scanned PDFs/images.

Smart Parsing

Split long docs into sections/clauses (headings, pages, tables).

Preserve key structure: titles, numbered clauses, bullet lists.

Plain-Language Summary

Generate a concise, 6th–8th grade reading-level summary.

Extract and explain terms, dates, parties, obligations, risks, deadlines, medications, dosages, diagnoses, procedures (as applicable).

Definitions & Jargon Buster

Inline tooltips for technical terms with friendly definitions.

Q&A Chat

Ask questions about the uploaded document; answers show citations (page/section).

Multilingual

UI language switcher; output summaries/Q&A in selected language (default English). Auto-detect doc language.

Safety + Disclaimers

Prominent banner: “Not medical or legal advice. For information only.”

Encourage consulting a licensed professional for decisions.

Privacy

Process files in-memory or temporary storage; show a “Delete file” button; auto-delete after session ends.

Nice-to-Have (Stretch)

Section Compare: Highlight differences between two versions (e.g., contract v1 vs v2).

Table/Chart Reader: Extract tabular data into readable lists.

Risk Flags: Detect red-flag clauses (auto-renewal, arbitration, fee schedules, PHI handling).

Export: Download summary + glossary + Q&A as PDF/Docx.

Bookmarks: Save important sections for quick return.

Voice Mode: Read summaries aloud.

Tech Stack (suggested)

Frontend: React + Tailwind.

Backend: Node/Express (or Python FastAPI).

OCR: Tesseract or OCR.space/Google Vision (if allowed).

LLM: Connect to an LLM API for:

chunked summarization

definition extraction

multilingual translation

retrieval-augmented Q&A with citations

Storage: In-memory for MVP; optional temporary object storage with auto-expiry.

Auth (optional): Passwordless email magic link or social login.

UX Flow

Landing: Upload doc → choose output language → accept disclaimer.

Processing: OCR (if needed) → chunk → analyze.

Results Dashboard (3 tabs):

Summary: Plain-language overview with section list & expanders.

Glossary: Terms/definitions; clickable highlights in text.

Q&A: Chat panel; answers show “Source: Page X / Section Y”.

Actions: “Translate summary,” “Download report,” “Delete file.”

Prompts (LLM)

Summarize (per chunk):
“You are a patient/client-friendly explainer. Rewrite the following {domain} text in plain language at a 6th–8th grade level. Keep it accurate and neutral. List key points, obligations, dates, risks, and next steps. Do not give legal or medical advice. Output in {target_language}. Text: {chunk}”

Glossary:
“Extract up to 25 technical terms from the document and define them simply in {target_language}. Return JSON: [{term, definition, page_refs:[...]}].”

Q&A with Citations:
“Answer the question based only on the provided chunks. Cite page/section IDs for every claim. If unknown, say you don’t know. Output in {target_language}. Question: {q}. Chunks: {retrieved_chunks_with_ids}.”

Retrieval/Citations

Chunk with IDs (e.g., p3_s2).

Embed chunks, do similarity search for Q&A.

Show citations as badges (e.g., “p3 s2”).

Security & Compliance

Show non-advice banner on every page.

No persistent storage by default; Delete button; auto-purge on session end.

If logs are kept for debugging, redact PHI/PII and allow user opt-out.

Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

Upload a 10-page legal PDF → get a 1–2 page plain summary in English with at least 5 citations.

Upload a scanned doctor’s visit summary (image/PDF) → OCR works; glossary ≥10 terms; multilingual output (e.g., Spanish).

Q&A returns answers with source references or “don’t know.”

Delete file removes content from storage and UI.
